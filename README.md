## Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Generic Utilities

### Phase 2 - Scenes
The user is able to save the position and attributes of all the `Nodes` on the canvas into a `Scene`.
The user is able to save multiple different `Scenes`.
The user is able to switch between `Scenes` with minimal delay.

### Phase 3 - Quality of Life
The user is able to change additional attributes of the `Nodes` including colour, size and font.
The user is able to delete `Nodes`.
The user is able to delete `Scenes`.

### Phase 4 - Relationships
The user is able to connect `Nodes` together with a line.
The user is able to connect `Nodes` together with a directed line.

### Phase 5 - Demo
Anyone who clones the project will have access to a `Sandbox Scene` where they can play around with the application.
Anyone who clones the project will have access to a `Demo Scene` where a pre-made `Scene` explains the very basics of Graph Theory.
